this program needs the color FERET dataset

download:
Get the colorferet dataset from: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/color-feret-database

untar:
tar xzf colorferet.tar

preprocess:
./convert_images.sh

The code expects the preprocessed dataset to be in the same folder as the executable with a dir named: "images_raw". Create a symlink to it from the file system.
That is drop a symlink in the workload_generator directory. Then compile the workload generator via make. This will create
two exectuables. 
 - gen_encrypted_dataset: pre-process the images stored in "images_raw" folder into an encrypted binary file called: "encrypted_dataset.txt". This file contains
requests (histograms+IDs) to be passed to the face verification server.
 - client: This executable is the one responsible with communicating with the server. It reads the pre-processed encrypted dataset of requests directly to memory
and can then stress the server to the max.

To run the server simply run make at the toplevel dir. This will create an executable called "sample" at the directory "enclaves_samples".
It expects a symlink of the images_raw in the "enclaves_samples" directory as the server reads the images into a database and then compares
requests made by the workload generator against the ones stored in the database.

For running with different configurations (#Threads\Use SUVM\Use RPC see defines macros in the code).
